# OrbitalAutoCropper

Proposal for Orbital 2020

Team Name: 

AutoCropper


Proposed Level of Achievement: 

Artemis


Motivation 
As the global agricultural workforce is diminishing every year, further stimulated by the shift to higher skilled and more lucrative jobs, there is a greater need for more automated crop growing processes with a low demand for human labour. Furthermore, with a rapidly growing population, there has been an exponential increase in the demand for food supplies. 
Such a demand is further exacerbated by climate change which greatly enforces the need to adopt optimal controlled environments for ideal crop cultivation by strengthening climate resilience. What can we do to alleviate this pressing issue in Singapore?


Local Context
The Singapore government aims to produce 30% of its nutritional needs by 2030 for greater food security in anticipation of supply or price fluctuations, which once again reiterates the importance of increasing agricultural productivity. Given the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore’s (AVA) desire to optimize local food production, a substantial amount of funding has been dedicated to support local farmers in boosting their productivity through the investment in innovative technology. With the growing emergence of many new local farmers, especially in the area of urban farming, these farmers may be limited by lack of substantial funding and experience in agriculture. So, how might we minimise the pressure faced by aspiring farmers who enter the agricultural industry in Singapore? 


Aim 
To design an automated, computer controlled environment for crop growth for the purpose of assisting local small-scale agricultural producers in enhancing their productivity. 


Target Audience
Local agricultural producers who operate on a small scale, as well as aspiring individuals who intend to enter the agricultural industry.







User Stories

As an agricultural producer, I would want to increase my crop output. To achieve this, knowledge of the ideal conditions needed for optimal crop growth is required and I would want to conduct preliminary testing to identify such conditions.
As a local producer interested in entering the field of urban farming, I have to account for the harsh and erratic environmental conditions that can be encountered and as such I would want to experiment if certain crops are feasible for urban cultivation.
As an agricultural producer, I want to introduce a new type of crop never grown in Singapore, and I would want to conduct experiments to identify the ideal conditions for optimal crop growth.
As a prospective and aspiring agricultural producer, I would want to avoid costly preliminary testing for ideal crop growing conditions. Having prior knowledge of the necessary conditions required to maximise crop growth would be beneficial.


Project Scope

The AutoCropper device is a user-operated hardware for the provision of a controlled
environment for crop growth. 

Rationale:
The primary goal would be to provide a platform for users to conduct preliminary testing on optimal crop growing conditions. This serves as an assurance to producers and to ensure greater reliability of proposed conditions for crop production before any large scale production is initiated.

Proposed Features:

Manually input desired environmental conditions for the growth of crops in a controlled environment. 
Fully self-automated where users can adjust the conditions at their own discretion
The 4 key conditions that would be controlled for includes: temperature, light intensity, fertiliser content and water
Programmed to measure and record the rate of growth, size of fruits, and other crucial data pertaining to crop growth. 


An android mobile app that provides an avenue for local producers to share the information obtained from self-conducted experiments in a common database which will be made accessible to all users. 

Rationale:
Having access to crucial information pertaining to crop growth can provide a greater sense of security to prospective farmers and provide more incentives for local producers to enter the industry.

Proposed Features:

Adopt Google’s firebase server to serve as a database for crucial information relating to crop growth
Local producers can contribute to the database with the knowledge gained from preliminary testing on crop growth using the AutoCropper
Easy accessibility to information regarding the ideal conditions for certain types of crops which have been cultivated previously


Future Plans/Considerations for extensions

In the long term, we plan to develop a comprehensive database that stores relevant information and data relating to crop growth in Singapore. This can include the following:
Optimal conditions to maximise growth rates and yields
Estimated growth rate/Time to maturation  
Estimated yields
Ideal periods to cultivate crops

Our project can be extended to accommodate other types of crops as well, including ornamental plants for recreational planters and locals who participate in allotment gardening.


Methodology and Proposed Timeline of Events:
